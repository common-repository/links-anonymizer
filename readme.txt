= What is the advantages of anonymizing your external links? =



If you link straight to a website then that website will easily be able to track which website you are linking from, based on a simple 'referrer' check. However, by using our link anonymizer service, all traffic will be redirected through our servers and the target page gets no information about the so-called referrer. 


Webmasters can use this tool to prevent their site from appearing in the server logs of referred pages as referrer. The operators of the referred pages cannot see where their visitors come from any more. Some people do it privacy. Some people do it to keep their sources unknown.
 

Anonymizer.info does exactly that: instantly create anonymous links. The service is free and requires no registration.
